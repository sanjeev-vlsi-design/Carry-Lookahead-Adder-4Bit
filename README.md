4-Bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)
Overview
The 4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) is a high-speed digital circuit designed to perform fast binary addition. Unlike ripple-carry adders, the CLA significantly reduces delay by calculating carry signals in parallel, enhancing performance in time-critical applications.

Features
4-Bit Binary Addition: Adds two 4-bit binary numbers with a carry input.
High-Speed Operation: Uses carry lookahead logic to minimize propagation delay.
Expandable Design: Easily scalable to higher bit-widths by cascading modules.
Optimized for Performance: Suitable for applications requiring fast arithmetic operations.
Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:
A[3:0]: 4-bit binary input operand A.
B[3:0]: 4-bit binary input operand B.
Cin: Carry input for cascaded operations.
Outputs:
Sum[3:0]: 4-bit binary sum of A and B.
Cout: Carry-out bit for extending addition to higher bits.
Design Approach
The Carry Lookahead Adder operates by:

Generating Propagate (P) and Generate (G) Signals:
Propagate (P = A XOR B) indicates if a carry will propagate through the bit.
Generate (G = A AND B) indicates if a carry is generated at a bit position.
Computing Carry Signals in Parallel:
Carry for each bit is calculated using the lookahead logic:

Delay Optimization
The CLA avoids ripple delays by precomputing all carry bits simultaneously, reducing the critical path delay.
